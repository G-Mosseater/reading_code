    Now comes the first thing we have never seen before, namely TypeScript.
    Try to read it and guess what it does, write in a comment what you think it will do
    Next use Google, ChatGPT and/or Claude to find out what it does.
    write in another comment what it actually does and see if it is far from what you thought it did
    - ->
    <script>
      document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "Hello, world!";
    </script>
    <!-- This line inserts a new html element called 'greeting' into our document(web-page) using .innerHTML property and assigns it the value of a string "Hello, world!"-->
  </body>
</html>
