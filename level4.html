        Imagine that we have Tailwind installed in our project.
        - ->
    <h1 class="bg-gray-300 text-red-400">
      is this different from the h1 in level 3, if so, how is it different?
    </h1>
    <!--the class in this line sets the background of the h1 element to gray-300 and text color to red-400 
    level 3 file had only a green text style applied -->
  </body>
